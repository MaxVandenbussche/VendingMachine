# VendingMachine
Project that includes schematics, PCB-designs and firmware for a vending machine.


## Introduction
At the local FabLab, [BUDA::lab](https://www.budalab.be), we got our hands on a large vending machine. This machine seemed in good mechanical state, but the electronics were broken and the coin-acceptor was outdated and did not accept euros.
